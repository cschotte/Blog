**My name is Clemens Schotte. I'm a [developer](https://github.com/cschotte), a dedicated and enthusiastic [storyteller](/blog/) with a passion for technology and [social interaction](https://twitter.com/cschotte).**

I blog about technology, gadgets, code, the web and everything I'm interested in. I love to teach, motivate, and entertain people with technical details.

I'm knowledgeable on **Microsoft** and **Open Source** technology and like to engage with people to exchange ideas and experiences. I'm spontaneous, flexible, and solve problems. I love the constant flow of innovation and new possibilities.
