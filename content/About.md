## Background

After graduating in 2002 from The Hague University, I started working as a software developer and created websites and web-related applications using PHP and C#. In 2007 I started working for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) as Dev Consultant, and from 2013 to 2017, I was Technical Evangelist. After ten years of working for Microsoft, I joined [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) as Solutions Architect. In 2019 I rejoined Microsoft as Cloud & Apps Specialist, where I still work. Interested to know more about what I did, have a look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cschotte/).
