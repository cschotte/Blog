NavaTron is a small software company founded and owned by Clemens Schotte in the year 2000. Custom software solutions for web, mobile, and Windows were developed for customers in the Netherlands. NavaTon is no longer an active company and is currently privately held. Thanks to all our customers we were able to operate for more than 21 years.
