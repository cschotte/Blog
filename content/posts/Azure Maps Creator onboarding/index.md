**Azure Maps Creator** is a powerful product that transforms your static floor plans into dynamic, interactive indoor maps for your business locations. It allows you to overlay technical building plans ontop of Azure Maps, enabling the visualization of IoT data such as temperature, occupancy, and other location-based services. The onboarding process is streamlined, requiring only the preparation and uploading of your **DWG floorplan** files (the native file format for Autodesk's AutoCAD software) into [Azure Maps Creator](https://aka.ms/azuremapscreator).

## Onboarding simplified

The [Azure Maps Creator onboarding tool](https://azure.github.io/azure-maps-creator-onboarding-tool/) has been designed to make the process of integrating DWG floorplans straightforward.

## Steps to onboard your indoor map

1. **Assign each DWG file to a facility level:** This step organizes the levels within your facility, enabling seamless floor transitions and wayfinding capabilities in your indoor map.
2. **Map DWG layers that will be converted:** Identify and map the DWG file layers that will be transformed into indoor map features, such as furniture or infrastructure components.
3. **Position Your Facility on the Map:** Place your indoor map accurately over a base map to ensure proper visualization and alignment.
