Hi, I am **Clemens Schotte**. My passion for technology and innovation has been the cornerstone of my career, guiding me through a remarkable journey within [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), currently as **Senior Program Manager** in the Maps & Local Product Group.

Since embarking on this path after my graduation from The Hague University in 2002, I have dedicated over two decades to the pursuit of technological excellence. My early years as a **software developer**, where I crafted dynamic web solutions using PHP and C#, laid the foundation for a career characterized by impactful innovation.

Joining Microsoft in 2007 as a **Consultant**, I had the privilege of architecting solutions that not only spurred business growth but also paved the way for transformative change. This role evolved into that of a **Technical Evangelist** between 2013 and 2017, during which I led initiatives to empower developers and nurture a culture of innovation.

My tenure at Dropbox as a **Solutions Architect** further refined my strategic and leadership skills, focusing on delivering customer-centric solutions. Returning to Microsoft in 2019, I brought back a wealth of knowledge and fresh perspectives, which have been instrumental in advancing our [Azure Maps](http://www.azuremaps.com/) services to new heights of excellence.

The diverse roles I have held at Microsoft reflect my ability to tackle complex challenges, foster collaboration, and devise strategic roadmaps that push the boundaries of what is possible.

As I look to the future, I am excited to continue this journey of innovation and discovery. At Microsoft, we will redefine the limits of technology and create transformative experiences that resonate across the globe.
